# Ford Car Price Prediction Project



Welcome to the Ford Car Price Prediction project! This project aims to predict the prices of Ford brand cars using deep learning techniques. The project includes data analysis, data preprocessing, visualization, and the implementation of a deep learning model using TensorFlow's Keras.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the prices of Ford brand cars based on various features. It involves the following stages:

1. **Data Collection:** Data is collected from Kaggle, a platform for data science and machine learning projects.
2. **Data Analysis and Preprocessing:** Exploratory data analysis is performed to understand the data. Data preprocessing techniques are applied to handle missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
3. **Data Visualization:** Visualizations are created to understand the distribution of features and their relationships with the target variable.
4. **Deep Learning Model:** A deep learning model is built using TensorFlow's Keras library for price prediction.
5. **Model Evaluation:** The trained model's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics.
